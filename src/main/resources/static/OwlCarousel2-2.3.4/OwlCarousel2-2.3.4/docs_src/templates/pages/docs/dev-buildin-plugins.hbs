## Built-in Plugins
> Owl Carousel supports plugin modular structure. This means that you can remove plugins that you won’t use or create new ones that fit your needs



### Plugins included

Following javascript files are concatenated in distributed owl.carousel.js and owl.carousel.min.js version. If you are looking for individual scripts please visit [Github]({{ pkg.homepage }}) and fork/download the source project


```
src/
└── js/
	├── owl.animate.js
    ├── owl.autoplay.js
    ├── owl.autoheight.js
    ├── owl.carousel.js
    ├── owl.hash.js
    ├── owl.lazyload.js
    ├── owl.navigation.js
    └── owl.video.js
```

Big thanks to [Artus Kolanowski](https://github.com/witrin) for helping me with modular structure and for providing best practice with developing the code.
